# 📊 Student Mental Health Dashboard

**Tech Stack:** MySQL · Excel · Tableau · Data Cleaning · Data Visualization · Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 🧠 Project Overview

This project analyzes mental health patterns among students to identify key drivers such as academic stress, age group, gender, and coping strategies. The dataset was processed using Excel and SQL, and visualized in Tableau to present data-driven insights through an interactive dashboard.

---

## ✅ Key Objectives

- Clean and preprocess the raw dataset using Excel and SQL
- Segment students by age group (`A1`, `A2`, `A3`) and gender
- Analyze factors influencing depression and anxiety levels
- Visualize insights with dynamic and filterable Tableau dashboards
- Deliver actionable takeaways using EDA techniques

---

## 📈 Tools & Technologies Used

- **MySQL:** Data transformation, grouping, aggregation, and CASE-based segmentation
- **Excel:** Initial cleaning, handling missing values, quick stats
- **Tableau:** Visualization of key metrics, comparative charts, and heatmaps
- **PowerPoint:** Presentation deck summarizing insights and recommendations
- **Video Walkthrough:** Demo recording of dashboard usage and interpretation

## 🔍 Key Insights

- The **A2 age group (18–21)** had the highest proportion of moderate to severe depression symptoms.
- **Academic stress** and **lack of peer support** were strongly linked to declining mental health.
- **Female students** reported higher stress levels during academic evaluations.
- Students with **positive coping mechanisms** (e.g., hobbies, social support) showed better mental well-being.

## 📌 Why This Project Matters

- Demonstrates end-to-end data analytics: from raw data → SQL preprocessing → dashboard delivery
- Mimics real-world reporting structure used in health and education analytics
- Showcases ability to deliver insights in a format accessible to non-technical stakeholders

## 🎥 Tableau Hosting Note

Since Tableau Public has limitations for private/interactive hosting without a paid account:
- A full **video walkthrough (`walkthrough.mp4`)** has been provided
- All project files can be run locally with **Tableau Desktop** or viewed via the presentation deck
