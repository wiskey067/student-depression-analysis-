# 📊 Student Mental Health Dashboard

**Tech Stack:** MySQL · Excel · Tableau · Data Cleaning · Data Visualization · Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 🧠 Project Overview

This project explores mental health patterns among students to uncover correlations between academic stress, sleep habits, study time, financial pressure, and overall well-being. The analysis pipeline includes Excel-based preprocessing, SQL querying, and interactive visualization in Tableau.

---

## ✅ Key Objectives

- Clean and preprocess raw mental health survey data using Excel and SQL
- Segment students by age group (`A1`, `A2`, `A3`) using SQL CASE logic
- Analyze the impact of study satisfaction, financial stress, and sleep duration on depression levels
- Visualize the trends and comparisons with interactive charts and filters in Tableau
- Communicate insights through presentation and video walkthrough

---

## 📈 Tools & Technologies Used

- **Excel:** Used for initial inspection, missing value handling, and pre-cleaning
- **MySQL:** For data transformation, grouping, and conditional logic queries
- **Tableau:** Built dynamic, filterable dashboards with bar charts, heatmaps, and trend analysis
- **PowerPoint:** For summarizing findings in a clear, visual format
- **MP4 Video:** Recorded walkthrough explaining the dashboard's key features and insights

## 🔍 Key Insights

- Students in **Group A2 (18–21)** exhibit the **highest levels of academic stress and depression**
- **Academic Pressure (AP-3)** and **low Study Satisfaction (SS-1)** were major red flags in mental health decline
- Students studying **>10 hours/day** or sleeping **<6 hours/night** had higher stress scores
- Financial stress was consistently linked with poor emotional well-being, especially in Groups A2 and A3

---

## 💡 Skills Demonstrated

- End-to-end data pipeline: **data ingestion → transformation → visualization**
- SQL for filtering, grouping, CASE-based categorization, and deriving actionable insights
- Dashboard building using Tableau with real-time filtering and comparative analysis
- Communication of complex data insights through PPT and a stakeholder-friendly walkthrough video
